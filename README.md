# Virginia Tech ETD template
ETD Format for Virginia Tech graduate students. Here is the [overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/virginia-tech-etd-template/dtdgfyqktvrd) of this format. This format makes my Ph.D. thesis writing more easily. I hope this will make your thesis writing easier. Good luck with your graduation!

Please note it isn't the official university template. This thesis format is modified based on official Virginia Tech LaTeX [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/virginia-tech-etd-template/cpqhbscstfrx#.WusPwtMvxBw) for theses and dissertation but with an easier organizing style. 
For more information on preparing your thesis or dissertation for submission, please see the [ETD LibGuide](https://guides.lib.vt.edu/c.php?g=547528&p=3756998) on the VT Libraries website.
