# VirginiaTech-thesis-overleaf
ETD Format for Virginia Tech graduate students. Please note it isn't the official university template. This thesis format is modified based on [this format](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/virginia-tech-etd-template/cpqhbscstfrx#.WusPwtMvxBw) but with an easier organizing style. Here is the [overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/virginia-tech-etd-template/dtdgfyqktvrd) of this format.

This format makes my Ph.D. thesis writing more easily. I hope this will make your thesis writing easier. Good luck with your graduation!
